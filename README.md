The present implementation of Thaumaturges 'Fling Magic' ability is clumsy compared to the versatility of using 'spells'. This adds 6 spells (3 normal, 3 boosted) that have multiselectors in them to enable more integration with the automation and smoothing the experience of using this feature.

For example, compare these two images:

It contains all the things you would need to use the ability to its full function with considerably less effort.

There are 6 version, 3 normal, and 3 'boosted' versions. They correlate to 'intial, adept, and paragon' implement benefits.

To use these spells, create a spell list like so:

Then drag and drop the spells to the cantrip section like you would any other.


-**GM Warning**-

The only thing you still need to watch out for if you care deeply about rules as written is that the feature only allows 1 element per tier, but the spell recognizes no such distinctions.
So, a player with the intial ability will be able to select all 3 every time, instead of the one they are technically restricted to.
